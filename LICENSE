You are not permitted to distort the Swyp protocol in a way that breaks or alters interoperability between this Software, and new or existing Swyp apps.  
You are free to use sub-pieces of this software, however these pieces may not be called "Swyp or Swipe" and must not claim Swyp compatability.
You may not claim to be endorsed by Swyp or ExoMachina.
You may not use ExoMachina's "Swyp" trademark as the first word of any published application's name without ExoMachina's permission. 
You must obey minimal visual conventions in implementing Swyp if you wish to publish a "Swyp" (Swyp compatable) app. Minimum visual conventions will be set with the first release of 'Swyp' for iOS, and will be listed in the README file subsequently. 

Permission is not given until January 2012 to use the "Swyp" name or to use this code in "Swyp Apps." 
A future notice will likely specify an earlier date-- this is because the protocol is not yet finalized.

The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software, as referenced in private or public source. Eg, if you copy a file verbatim, leave the notice.
